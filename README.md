This is an official [Credova](https://credova.com) demo app that showcases how to integrate Credova Payment Services with your Ecommerce or Platform of choice.

This app uses Javascript, React & Next.js, but you are free to use whatever language you would like. Refer to the [developer documentation](https://developers.credova.com/) for detailed explanations for each language.

## Quick start

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn i
# or
pnpm i
# or

Second, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the api key variables named `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDOVA_API_KEY` and `CREDOVA_API_SECRET` from your account in the [Credova portal](https://portal.credova.com/developers/api-keys).

Third, run the development server:
